### Don't Face the IRS Alone

Dealing with IRS tax problems can be one of the most stressful experiences of your life. Threatening letters, wage garnishments, bank levies, and tax liens can turn your world upside down. You don't have to face the IRS alone. Our experienced tax resolution specialists handle complex IRS cases every day and know exactly how to protect your rights and achieve the best possible outcome.

### Our IRS Resolution Services:

- Review and analysis of IRS letters and notices
- Professional response drafting
- Direct communication with IRS agents
- Status updates and timeline management
- Protection from IRS intimidation tactics

**2. Installment Agreements (IRS Payment Plans)**
Can't pay your full tax bill? An IRS installment agreement allows you to pay your tax debt over time in manageable monthly payments.

**We help you:**

- Long-term payment plans (up to 72 months)

**3. Offer in Compromise (Settle for Less)**
An Offer in Compromise (OIC) allows you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount owed. This is often the best solution for taxpayers who cannot afford to pay their full tax liability.

**5. Wage Garnishment & Bank Levy Release**
The IRS has the power to seize your wages and bank accounts without going to court. If you're facing or experiencing a wage garnishment or bank levy, immediate action is critical.
