            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                Simplified Accounting Solutions, LLC was founded with a simple mission: to make professional accounting and tax resolution services accessible, understandable, and stress-free for individuals and businesses alike.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                We understand that dealing with the IRS can be intimidating and overwhelming. Tax codes change constantly, IRS regulations seem deliberately confusing, and facing a tax problem alone can feel impossible. That's where we come in.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                With our Enrolled Agent expertise, we take the burden off your shoulders. We communicate directly with the IRS on your behalf, translate complex tax matters into plain language, and work tirelessly to resolve your tax issues while protecting your rights.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                Whether you're an individual dealing with back taxes, a small business owner facing an audit, or someone who needs help with IRS collections—we're here to be your voice at the IRS.
